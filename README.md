# Amoni Haynes - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About  
Hi, my name is Amoni. I have a background in Communications and Public Relations, and I'm currently working on completing my Google Data Analytics certification.  

Within my Public Relations and Communications career, I've utilized and compiled different sets of data to help produce and execute creative campaign ideas for clients.  

I'm now continuing to learn and hone my skills through continuous learning and data analysis case studies.  

In my free time, I love to work on case studies across different sectors to further familiarize myself with tools such as R, Python, SQL, and more. I'm very much a sponge and love to learn new things and pick up new skills.  

I'm always looking for opportunities to grow, get my feet wet, and start a career within the realm of Data Analytics.
