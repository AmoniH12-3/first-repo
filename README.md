# Amoni Haynes - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About  
Hi, my name is Amoni. I have a background in Communications and Public Relations, and I'm currently working on completing my Google Data Analytics certification.  

Within my Public Relations and Communications career, I've utilized and compiled different sets of data to help produce and execute creative campaign ideas for clients.  

I'm now continuing to learn and hone my skills through continuous learning and data analysis case studies.  

In my free time, I love to work on case studies across different sectors to further familiarize myself with tools such as R, Python, SQL, and more. I'm very much a sponge and love to learn new things and pick up new skills.  

I'm always looking for opportunities to grow, get my feet wet, and start a career within the realm of Data Analytics.

### Case Study: Online Retail Sales Analysis (SQL + Tableau)
This case study explores sales performance for an online retail store using real-world transactional data. Using SQL for data wrangling and Tableau for visualization, I've discovered the customer trends, product insights, and revenue breakdowns.

### 📊 Key Insights:

### Top-selling products
- The bestsellers are primarily low-cost decorative items, like the Regency Cakestand or the Little Birdie Paper Craft, often bought in bulk.
- The top 10 products make up a large share of total revenue.
- The company should use this info and focus on stocking more popular SKUs such as the top 10 highest selling products, and bundling similar items with them.

### Monthly revenue trends
- A noticable trend of increase in revenue throughout the year occured from September and reached its peak revenue in November at $1,161,817, hinting at possible sales and promotions provided in preparation for the holiday season.
- From the data, January typically seems to underperform, suggesting a post-holiday decrease in demand.
- Focusing on more sales and promotions within the fall and winter months for the 2012 cycle could help the business earn more revenue and potentially surpass the previous high of $1,161,817 in November of 2011.

### Top customers by spend
- A small number of repeat customers generate a significant portion of sales—indicative of strong B2B activity.These customers place multiple, large-value orders, increasing their lifetime value.
-Focusing on customer retention and personalized deals for top buyers could enhance long-term revenue.

### Revenue by country
- The United Kingdom remains the dominant market, but international sales show promise in:
-Netherlands
-Germany
-France
-EIRE (Ireland)
- With this information, there's an opportunity to develop targeted marketing campaigns within these areas to maintain a core consumer base.

### Sales by day
-Tuesday and Thursday obtained the highest sales volume—possibly aligned with email promotions or restocks.
-Weekends (Saturday & Sunday) see lower sales, likely due to B2B-focused customer base operating during weekdays.
-Understanding the day-of-week patterns provides better insight into potential campaign launches, as well as restocking, and staff scheduling strategies.
